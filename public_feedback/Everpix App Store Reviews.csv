11/3/2013,IE,5,MadDogGreener,2.1.1,The best way to back up your photos,Have all my photos on laptop and phone backed up into one place. The flashback feature is great also.
11/2/2013,GB,5,We are:london,2.1.1,Amazing photo album,"It's a huge dilemma, how to save and view millions of photos. This app not only solves the problem, it solves loads of others. I'm a keen photographer and run a design agency, this app is amazing. See all your photos, get great history reminders and discover old photos, never loose another photo again. The best app I've ever paid for or owned. Worth every penny. Love it!!!!"
11/2/2013,US,3,jesaf00,2.1.1,Good but...,"Needs to be able to easily create albums and needs to add pictures faster. Takes forever to ""process""."
11/1/2013,FR,5,Grégory Delabrèche,2.1.1,Solution ultime pour sauvegarder ses photos,"Excellent, l'interface est top. Des fonctions sympathiques. On s'occupe de rien tout est automatique. Je conseille vivement"
10/31/2013,GB,5,Nickadg,2.1.1,Everpix is awesome,"i cant recommend this enough. i have it working on my iphone ipad and macbook. I have paid for the premium subscription and i love the fact that all my photos are backed up in the cloud.i love the flashback feature which really helps to keep my photo library ""live"".Finally it is great for sharingtwo improvements i would recommend are:1- ability to sync movies shot on iphone/ ipad2 - ability to provide a read only access to all photons for family members. Would save me having to remember to email updates to my familyotherwise keep up the great work"
10/30/2013,JP,5,戸田 勝也,2.1.1,フラッシュバックが面白いです,1年前、2年前の同じ日に撮った写真があるとフラッシュバックというところに表示されるのが楽しいです。
10/30/2013,US,4,Ut2013,2.1.1,Great app,I love this app! It's great for rediscovering old pictures. You can sync from a lot of different sources. It's not great at recognizing duplicates and there's no manual way to do it. I would also like to add descriptions or tags in some way. I will keep using this app.
10/23/2013,NL,5,Selachii,2.1.1,Awesome,Super service
10/20/2013,BR,5,Ednan,2.1.1,Muito bom,"Um excelente serviço que coloca todas (não só as do iPhone/iPad) fotos que você tem de maneira elegante e inteligente, sem ter que se preocupar com fotos duplicadas e etc."
10/20/2013,BR,5,Ednan,2.1.1,Muito bom,"Um excelente serviço que coloca todas (não só as do iPhone/iPad) fotos que você tem de maneira elegante e inteligente, sem ter que se preocupar com fotos duplicadas e etc."
10/20/2013,US,3,Rkcrawf,2.1.1,Good concept: needs improvements,The app works fine for the most part (although an image uploaded 10 minutes ago shows as 4 hours old). I'd like to be able to edit date for a photo or a group of photos. A map for the geotags would also be nice.
10/19/2013,CA,5,Not to be Burned in Burnaby,2.1.1,Love the flashbacks,Every day I get a flashback email of this day in history. It keeps my photos forgotten photos present for me to enjoy. Great app.
10/18/2013,GB,4,DaleJefferson,2.1.1,"Great service, not the best app","All my photos are backed up, and I can view them on my iPad or on the web, it just works."
10/18/2013,DE,5,tripr,2.1.1,Foto Archivierung,"Mit gefällt das Everpix Konzept und ich gucke mir meine Bilder jetzt deutlich öfter an als vorher. Gerade die Bilder die ich am Pc hochladen sehe ich so öfter, da sie sonst auf der externen Festplatte verschwinden. Zum häufigen betrachten der Bilder trägt besonders die 'Today' Funktion bei. Sie zeigt die Bilder, die ihr genau vor X Jahren gemacht habt. Tolle Funktion!Klar an der Strukturierung der Bilder (Tags wären gut) kann man noch arbeiten, aber der Dienst entwickelt sich ständig weiter (schaut mal auf deren Blog)."
10/17/2013,ES,5,Carles Bruguera Artero,2.1.1,Por fin,"Una aplicacion fàcil i con lo justo. Despues de años con picasa, muy contento del cambio"
10/16/2013,US,5,ThunderNole,2.1.1,Awesome!,"I have tried a bunch of different photo storage services, from Google Plus, and Flickr to more traditional storage like Pogoplug and Skydrive and hands downs this crushes them all. Fast upload speeds and deduplication of photos are huge pluses for me."
10/14/2013,AU,5,thinker0876,2.1,Great,Used this app to keep pics safely on cloud while travelling over 5 weeks. Happy with ease of syncing photos from iPhone
10/13/2013,ES,5,colomain,2.1.1,Perfecta app de backup de fotos,"Perfecta para guardar todas tus fotos. Hace backup automático de las librerías de fotos que le configures, teniendo en cuenta duplicados. Y me encanta la opción de Flashback que cada día me envía fotos de ese día pero de años anteriores."
10/9/2013,US,5,Mefisto82,2.1.1,The BEST photo app!!!,"Saznao sam preko nekih portala za ovu aplikaciju...i odmah sam je testirao :) Zadovoljan sam idejom, dizajnom, lakoćom korišćenja i funkcionalnošću. Ja dosta volim fotografiju i imam dosta slika...tako da mi treba i dosta mesta na cloud-u... Ova app ne broji MB koliko ih potrošim već vremenski period ;) Koji se naravno može dokupiti $ ili ""akcijama"" (deliti link prijateljima, instalirati app za Windows, sinhronizovati neke fotke i sl.). ODLIČNA!"
10/8/2013,US,1,Fleedar,2.1.1,No portrait mode,"Bizarrely, this app can only be used in landscape orientation on iPad. I can't fathom the reason behind this design decision."
10/7/2013,GR,5,Rablex,2.1.1,like,better than photostream! good job guys!
10/7/2013,FR,5,Shrekobba,2.1.1,Meilleur appli pour images dans le cloud!Mais...,"...mais pas d'option de sync pour linux, pour mettre mes photos sur everpix je suis obligé d'utiliser l'OS Windows ou MAC. J'espère ça vient bientôt!! Quand même 5 étoiles car j'ai trouvé finalement une solution claire, facile et innovante pour stocker tous mes photos à une place, en privée (public si voulait)!"
10/6/2013,DE,5,HReinard,2.1.1,Beste Photo Archive in the cloud,If you have digital photos with valid date and time and geo tags then Everpix is unbeatable. I uploaded my more than 200.000 photos and enjoy every day that I have done this. The only way until now to do so.
10/6/2013,US,5,Ragiepew,2.1.1,Best overall photo roll,"Have tried many of the infinite photo roll options out there (loom, G+, picturelife, Flickr, etc) and this is the best overall package.  My favorite features include the ability to have many sources of photos (FB, iPhone, iPhoto, Flickr, email for me) all in one roll, deduplicating(!), flashbacks.Features I'm hoping come soon are Auto-enhance (a la G+), simpler delete ability, and more usable PhotoPages (in iOS).Great all around product and looking forward to future and frequent updates."
10/4/2013,US,4,Rick Austin,2.1.1,Nearly perfect,"The only thing missing is support for tagging or editing metadata. If I could edit, then search for photos by tags or metadata, this service would be perfection itself."
9/29/2013,FR,5,Calusarys,2.1.1,La révolution du classement des photos.,"Everpix a changé ma vie ^^ Fini le classement laborieux des photos, tout est automatisé, facile, rapide ! Et en plus l'application bénéficie d'un design top ! Mention spéciale au Flashback journalier, merci de nous faire nous souvenir de tous ces bons moments !"
9/28/2013,ES,5,Nachovy,2.1.1,La mejor app para sincronizar fotos y compartir,"Lo dicho, una aplicación bestial para mantener sincronizadas las apps entre iOS y OS X (Supongo q también Windows)Así debería ser fotos en streaming se Apple.Brutal la forma de mandar las fotos a familiares mediante Photo Pages...Un 10"
9/28/2013,US,4,korou,2.1.1,Brings back memories...,"I like the new changes in iOS 7; switching back from one picture to the larger gallery is easier. This service is honestly amazing and I open the app after midnight each day to see what pictures I took 1, 2, 6, whatever years ago."
9/28/2013,US,3,Evan Frenkel,2.1.1,Crashes,Explore crashes on iOS 7. Needs an update. I love Everpix though!
9/24/2013,CN,5,Intoskip,2.1.1,赞一个,非常棒！
9/22/2013,DE,5,SiraCusaR,2.1,Perfect,Perfect App for a Perfect Service!
9/22/2013,FR,4,bastou75,2.1.1,Excellent mais pb ios7,"Les versions précédentes nécessitaient un abonnement hors de prix. Et l'interface était minimaliste. On est désormais a l'opposé : diablement simple et efficace, on commence a prendre plaisir a l'utiliser. Sauf depuis ios7 ...On a plus que quelques photos et surtout perdu la fonction flashbackA découvrir."
9/20/2013,US,4,jennyb23,2.1,"Nice app, great service!",I love the flashbacks.
9/20/2013,US,5,bnwklr,2.1,Everpix is the greatest!,Photo management used to be a giant pain. Now it's a pleasure. Everpix makes me happy every day!
9/18/2013,US,3,Zone1982,2.1,"Great, but...",Can we please do everything in portrait?
9/17/2013,US,5,JeffLikesBikes,2.1,Works great,Does what it is supposed to and looks great.
9/17/2013,US,5,GD Mac,2.1,great app,highly recommend the app especially with large photo libraries!! it works fantastic and the flashback feature is killer!
9/16/2013,US,5,Mickie233,2.1,Nice,Great app.
9/15/2013,GB,5,carlbob,2.1,The only way to manage photos,Quite why Apple haven't bought these guys and integrated this into iOS and Mac OS I have no idea - this is the way that Photos should work. Indispensable app and service. Video support would be icing on the cake.
9/15/2013,US,1,nacaseven,2.1,Everpix is awesome!,"It's a great service, I already pay for it.The app is crap though, keeps crashing on my iPad 2 and iPhone 4s."
9/14/2013,DK,4,Stig Skov Mortensen,2.1,Glimrende app,Viser dine billeder på farten. Rigtig god at dele fra også.
9/14/2013,FR,4,Ed1980,2.1,Excellent service,"Le service rendu est très bien pensé, archiver et redécouvrir ses photos de façon simple, en tâche de fond.Les App iPhone et ipad sont intuitives et agréables.Il ne manque plus que la prise en charge des vidéos."
9/14/2013,US,4,Malaparte,2.1,Good photo organizer app,"Stable, responsive app. Would like to see more functionality around organizing/searching/tagging. Would also like to see the scope broaden to include videos."
9/14/2013,US,5,christiaanv,2.1,All my photos in one place!,"This app and service has changed how I keep, view and share my photos. No more worrying whether I balked up the right photos. Favorite part of the app: Flashback! It's super fun to see what we were up to one, 6 or 8 years ago on this very day!!"
9/14/2013,US,4,KatiePierce83,2.0.6,Person,Great app! Love the flashback!
9/14/2013,US,4,ogbabo,2.1,Good app,"Speedy, efficient app.  Lacks some functionality (album creation, etc.). Features continue to be rolled out."
9/13/2013,IT,5,Giorgio Parravicini,2.1,Ottima,"App funzionale e servizio ottimo. Comodo per gestire una vasta libreria ed averla sempre a portata di mano. Elimina in automatico i duplicati, analizza le foto e le ordina. Non sostituisce una buona libreria di iPhoto o Aperture, ma ne e' un valido compagno."
9/13/2013,DE,5,fexx,2.1,So machen Fotos Spaß,"Super Service und Super App. So machen die eigenen Fotos Spaß. Alles an einem Ort, alles gesichert und man kann stundenlang durch alte Fotos stöbern."
9/13/2013,US,4,FlowerGuy,2.1,More than I expected.,"W/ huge volume of pics, finding one that you want to show someone- this works great."
9/13/2013,US,4,Barry Bates,2.1,Nice app,I highly recommend it
9/13/2013,US,5,nephron,2.0.6,Great app,I love the way it surfaces old photos. My wife and I have gotten a kick out of seeing all the old photos again. It has made me fall in love with my photo collection. I had no idea I had so many great photos. I wish the iPhone app had some more photo editing abilities.
9/13/2013,US,5,KSTech,2.0.6,Excellent cross platform syncing,Flashback feature is genius and engaging.
9/12/2013,FR,5,egrosdidier,2.1,On frôle la perfection,"Plein de petits ""plus"" inutiles à détailler ici (cf le descriptif de l'App).Fonctionnelle, interface agréable, et, surtout, comblement d'un manque rédhibitoire des versions précédentes : on peut enfin supprimer des photos via l'App, sans devoir passer par l'interface web.Un excellent service à prix raisonnable, une excellente intégration à nos iDevices Apple, multiples possibilités d'export et de synchronisations avec divers services et réseaux sociaux : parfait.La suite sera du bonus, toujours bon à prendre.Vu ce qu'elle nous montre ici, cette société va savoir nous surprendre encore pour le meilleur, j'en suis certain."
9/12/2013,GB,4,anthughes,2.1,"Great app, excellent service",Both fun and useful. I have every photo I've ever taken in my pocket and it takes no time at all to locate the specific one I want to see at any given moment. Now just needs RAW and video support support to put it well ahead of the competition.
9/12/2013,CA,5,Kylerbar,2.1,Excellent means of backing up,"Great, quick and generally awesome way if backing up my iPhone photos; love it!"
9/11/2013,GB,5,dylanski,2.0.6,Finally someone who gets how to handle photos,Love it. Easy. Smooth. Practical. Now to unravel my old iPhoto libraries.
9/11/2013,GB,5,Rjm400,2.0.6,Great Storage,Great way to keep all your photos safe. Easy to do and use as its automatic! Probably the best out there.

9/11/2013,CH,5,rschellenberg,2.0.6,Macht Spass,Einfach zu bedienen. Rückblick bringt Erinnerungen wieder zurück.
9/11/2013,RU,4,-Disiel-,2.0.6,Норм,"Вроде ничего, пойдёт. Почему-то не все фото залил."
9/11/2013,US,5,Mfg36,2.0.6,Excellent,Use this everyday. Love seeing daily flashbacks. Fast and easy to use.
9/11/2013,US,5,Akag9,2.0.6,Very good!,I like it a lot. Fast upload. Some glitches but overall great. Flashbacks are superb!Hope product gets refined.At least until someone buys them and shuts them down... /sigh
9/10/2013,US,5,Tennessee Williams' Cousin,2.0.6,Excellent,Really like this application. Takes one worry out of my mind for good. Invaluable.
9/10/2013,US,5,zorba02460,2.0.6,Pure awesome,Apple should pay these guys and make this the default way to organize pics. Wife agrees. I hope they add videos at some point too.
9/9/2013,US,5,Charlie:),2.0.6,Better than photo stream!,It won't use up that much of space of you phone and it sync even your iPhoto and any other photos in your computers! I hope they support videos in the future!
9/8/2013,GB,5,Hamiiii,2.0.6,"Simple, but that's all that's needed","The app does everything you'd expect it to do and does so with no hassle at all. It could have other things added to it (and may well do with the release of iOS 7, e.g. Background syncing, maybe even video) but even as is, it's an excellent app"
9/8/2013,FR,5,Benjamin Sa,2.0.6,Un must pour un backup efficace et compréhensif de ses photos,Et tout fonctionne !
9/8/2013,FR,5,zeBooZ,2.0.6,Très pratique et très beau!,"Un outil à la fois performant pour mettre à l'abri ses photos, mais surtout pour y avoir accès partout, n'importe quand. Équipe réactive, bugs rapidement corrigés, et abonnement à prix très compétitif. Un must have!"
9/8/2013,US,5,RMC 70,2.0.6,Love it,It is like having something to refresh my memory of what I was doing most days in the 13 years.
9/8/2013,US,3,TwinsFan8791,2.0.6,"4+ stars for the service, 2 stars for the app","Love the service. It's nearly flawless. My single complaint is that duplication can't figure out Instagram pics and the original as duplicates. And I get that technically they aren't duplicates. But they're close. I digress. The app itself could use some work. No portrait is annoying. Too much tapping to get from ""moment"" to ""moment."" Doesn't seem to auto-update or pull down new pics from the cloud quickly. My biggest gripe is that I wish it could just replace my Photos app. But it can't. I don't want to send a link to an everpix page when I share a picture. I also don't want to download it, then share it, then delete it. I don't know if that's an iOS limitation or a design decision."
9/7/2013,DE,5,NerdismBlog.de,2.0.6,Genial praktisch!,Eine einfach zu bedienende App. Es war noch nie so simpel ein Backup seiner geliebten Fotos zu erstellen.
9/7/2013,US,5,CwillMGMT,2.0.6,EverPix,Pulls all photos from all devices together in 1 place. My wife and I are enjoying pictures we haven't looked at in years. Get a subscription for $50 per year. You'll make that back in time saved the first day you start. Am buying subscriptions for my adult children so we have easier access to grandkids photos.
9/7/2013,US,5,wisc75,2.0.6,Best photo service especially for Mac users,Finally a solution that reads your iPhoto library and uploads to the web.  I've tried every solution out there and this one rocks!
9/7/2013,US,5,wrhubbard,2.0.6,Best pic app ever,Best pic app ever.
9/6/2013,GB,5,Anonymous Howard,2.0.6,Wonderful,"Works like magic, all my photos to browse when I wantVery speedy support as well when I had an issue, plus robust desktop client. Change exit data and the changes propagate easily. All it needs to be perfect is video."
9/6/2013,CH,5,Jonas987,2.0.6,Perfect,Works great displaying your pictures
9/6/2013,US,5,tdpearl,2.0.6,Love the Flashback!,We have 2 yr olds and to see daily what they looked like a year ago is really fun!

9/5/2013,US,5,Magnus-Andreas Aase,2.0.6,Fantastic—the most useful photo service I have ever used.,"Never mind that it syncs all the images from all your devices, removes duplicates, organizes them by date, etc.—all which is great and done in an elegant way.The ""wow""-feature is the simple, yet brilliant, flashback of images you took on in the past on that specific date. It has become a daily tradition for me and my family to look at!Great work!"
9/4/2013,GB,5,Andy-Carlisle,2.0.6,Safe and fun,"Great storage and backup, great apps, love the flashback, to remember old photos"

9/3/2013,US,3,Zone1982,2.0.6,"Awesome, but....",Please allow for portrait orientation. Not allowing it is a massive oversight.
9/3/2013,US,4,John zakarai,2.0.6,Pretty good,Needs video support
9/2/2013,FR,4,Grego75,2.0.6,Prometteuse,Application qui semble prometteuse. À voir à la longue si elle tient ses promesses d'efficacité en matière de tri et stockage dans le cloud.
9/2/2013,US,4,CPOSharkey,2.0.6,"Very Good, Duplicate Control Needs Work","It seems to be the best option for power users. I'm not sure I trust that they won't raise prices in the future, but that's speculation for all cloud services."
9/2/2013,CA,5,holeyman,2.0.6,enjoy the service,like icloud for pictures but multi sourcereally handy and works well

8/30/2013,US,5,Bripab007,2.0.6,Nearly perfect,This has got to be the most painless way to sync a photo library and be able to logically sort through it and share photos with others. If only it synced video...
8/30/2013,US,5,austicious,2.0.6,A large portion of the population will want this.,This is perfect for all the people that desperately want to organize their photos but don't have the time to do so.
8/30/2013,US,5,Winkyeah,2.0.6,"Fast, well-executed, and useful",This app and its accompanying service are fantastic. Constantly updated. The best photo service I've used and I've tried everything from Smugmug to Flickr to Zenfolio. Perfect for sharing memories.
8/29/2013,AU,3,lemmalemma,2.0.6,Flashbacks are good,It would be the complete photo managing app if it had tagging.
8/29/2013,US,4,Samacur,2.0.5,Good photo collection,"Nice way of gathering all photos into one nice interface. I really like the ""day in history"", photo pages, and the ""highlights"". Room for improvement:Include videosPhoto editingSimplified ordering of multiple photos at once"
8/29/2013,CA,5,Aaron Adetuyi,2.0.6,Great way to backup/organize pictures.,This is a great app and worth the annual price.

8/28/2013,NL,5,Juan Esteban Rios,2.0.6,Great app!,A great option to store your valuable memories. Works great in all devices.
8/28/2013,AU,4,massivechicken,2.0.6,Good but,"Needs the following;1. Delete photo ability from all clients (I don't want ALL my photos synced). I know you can hide from the web client but this is a cumbersome, tiring experience with multiple photos to delete.2. More photo discovery features. The best part about this app is being surprised by old photos of events that you forgot about. I.e have a location filter3. Actual integration with the mosaic product instead of just a link to the dodgy app.Brilliant service. Subscriber for life. Am sure it can only get better"
8/28/2013,US,5,ozt1ks,2.0.6,May be the best photo service out there...,"Been looking for a photo service where I could upload pictures from multiple services and be able to see them on all my devices (MacBook air, iPad, and iPhone, as well as on the web hopefully). The main contenders in the area are: Everpix, Loom, and Flickr.Everpix gets all the major services (iPhoto library, Facebook, Instagram), provides ""flashback"" (a look at past photos on the same day in past years) automatically, and de-duplication.Loom is good for album views.Flickr is decent at sharing and for a social piece.To top it off, the support from the Everpix team is great.... Fast response and accurate answers."
8/28/2013,US,4,straylight990,2.0.5,Pretty solid,"Lacking some key features (delete, for example) from the full desktop site, but otherwise a lovely way to browse my 60k photos."
8/27/2013,GB,4,David Tanner,2.0.5,Excellent app for viewing and archiving your photos,The Flashback feature is particularly great.
8/27/2013,NL,4,Ron Digger,2.0.5,Everpix,These guys found a really nice and convenient way to manage your photos. The flashback feature of this app ensures that you will see photos from last year instead of hiding them somewhere in a folder on your harddisk. Great!
8/27/2013,US,5,gBrad,2.0.5,A trip down memory lane,"This has quickly become our favorite app! Every morning, we look forward to seeing pictures from the past. Great idea, great execution."
8/25/2013,GB,5,bartlet4ever,2.0.5,Just works,It's great
8/25/2013,US,5,World traveler99,2.0.5,Awesome App!!!,Love the flashback feature.  I love it when I get an alert to check out the new flash back.  It puts my old photo to use.
8/24/2013,GB,5,paulgrav,2.0.5,Great way to store and share pics,The app is great. Works way better than Dropbox at syncing your pics.
8/24/2013,GB,5,KieranYo,2.0.5,10/10/2013,Exactly what I have been waiting for. Planning to upgrade to paid member very soon.
8/24/2013,DE,5,widemedia,2.0.5,Best ever....,macht richtig Spass! Super gemacht.
8/24/2013,FR,5,Orfalaise,2.0.5,Application bien pensée!,"J'ai découvert Everpix il y a un mois et ai souscrit à l'option payante. C'est très bien conçu, mes photos sont accessibles à partir de tous mes appareils et de n'importe quel ordinateur. Les photos prennent très peu de place, plus besoin de saturer la mémoire de l'iPhone... À essayer sans hésiter..."
8/24/2013,US,5,SethTrudeau,2.0.4,It's the little things,"Everpix just does everything I want it to do. Intuitive storage & organization, easy sharing, clean interface. And then it does some things I enjoy but would never asked for, like the flashback emails. It's great, and I can easily imagine that I'll pay some money for it in the near future."
8/24/2013,US,5,Sparks66,2.0.5,Awesome!,"Definitely worth the $50 per year. All 23,000 of my photos are safely backed up and everything works in the background on all devices and macs. Also love the flashback emails."
8/24/2013,CA,5,parasthehurricanemehta,2.0.5,Excellent,Easy to navigate and use. What iCloud should be.
8/23/2013,CH,5,Meravino,2.0.5,👍,Everpix è un servizio eccezionale che consente di avere accesso alle proprie foto da ovunque. Ne sono altamente soddisfatto.
8/23/2013,US,5,mjpost,2.0.5,What iPhoto should be,This app is great. The daily flashbacks are one of the best features.
8/23/2013,US,5,KingNothing72,2.0.5,Great app,All my photos in one place. Love it.
8/23/2013,US,1,DogSolitude,2.0.5,Kill the Pop-Ups,Enough with the pandering pop-ups. I reviewed your wonderful service when I paid for it. Developers shouldn't be rewarded for poor behavior.
8/22/2013,IT,3,Dr. Bernardi,2.0.5,I like the app,"I think the subscription prices are too high, tho. Wouldn't mind throwing a buck or two per month, but 5 is way too much for just photos, and even with the yearly subscription it doesn't get much cheaper."
8/21/2013,IT,4,get_enzo,2.0.5,Ottima,Ottima applicazione: meriterebbe 5 stelle se ci fosse una funzione simile al backup da cloud
8/20/2013,GB,5,G9A5,2.0.5,Miles better than Flickr,A photo app I instantly paid the subscription for. Clever and useful in equal measure. Big fan.
8/19/2013,GB,5,jpsjsj,2.0.5,Awesome,"Awesome app, rediscovered so many old photos. So easy to use and it processes everything so quickly. Got my 30,000+ library in there very quickly!"
8/19/2013,US,5,Hermitcrabb,2.0.2,Finally seeing memories!,The email that sends you pics from this day in past years is a killer app. I've not gotten this much joy from my photo collection ever. Thanks!
8/19/2013,US,5,wkeving,2.0.5,Excellent tool for consolidating all photos to the cloud,"So far, Everpix delivers. The initial sync/upload from my iPhoto library of over 25K photos took over 24 hours, but it was worth it. The app meets and exceeds my expectations so far. The best feature is Flashback. I love the daily flashback showing me my historical photos. Offers a moment of daily reflection on how fast time flies."
8/19/2013,US,5,buddra,2.0.5,Perfection,This should be built into every Apple device. It's just perfect.
8/18/2013,GB,4,Stupot,2.0.5,"Great app, especially the memories page","Great app which brings my digital collection together nicely. I am using my Camera roll from my IOS devices, plus Picasa and Fickr. The memory email which I receive on most days is superb: a snapshot (sorry) of shots from a randomly selected day in the past, nicely presented, always brings a smile. Getting updates added more frequently would earn an easy 5/5."
8/18/2013,US,5,Alonso Pérez,2.0.5,One word... AWESOME,"Pros: - Total backup of your pictures from many devices as you want.- Secure data encryption - Unlimited storage. (yeah, no kidding)Cons: Hope in an older version, I could sync my videos too. It would be perfectMeanwhile, I TOTALLY RECOMMEND IT"
8/18/2013,US,5,Donnie Millar,2.0.5,"Great app, but deleting photos is a pain",It seems they don't understand the use case for bulk deleting photos. You cannot delete unwanted photos on the app and only on the website one by one.
8/18/2013,US,5,Maximus Glutius,2.0.3,Life Changing :),"This app, and Everpix in general, really has made a huge impact for my wife and I. Aside from giving us piece of mind by backing up hundreds of gigs worth of photos, it's been truly mind blowing to have access to every photo from our phones. Can't recommend it enough!"
8/17/2013,SE,5,Boppe05,2.0.5,Bästa molnbackupen för dina bilder,"Everpix löser enkelt dina problem med lagring och backup om du har tusentals bilder på din dators hårddisk. Bilderna sorteras efter datum, och går lätt att airplaya till din tv om du har en Apple TV kopplad till den. Högsta betyg! Så här borde bildhanteringen ordnas i iOS istället för funktionen ""bildström""."
8/17/2013,GB,5,Dmee,2.0.5,Amazing,Wonderful idea
8/17/2013,AU,5,Jakodai,2.0.5,Amazing!,I'm not looking at photos that I haven't seen for years. I find myself looking forward to my flashback email each morning. It's fantastic!
8/17/2013,HK,5,Norman Li,2.0.5,Great app,Great app to store all your photos in the cloud.
8/17/2013,US,4,Cfountain72,2.0.5,This is what iCloud should be...,"Does what it claims, and does it very well. We have two iPhones, two iPads, an iMac with iPhoto, and it handles photos from all sources very easily. Plus, the daily 'flashback' email is a great reminder of why we take photos to begin with: to help remember what we did and where we were.My only complaint is that it would be nice to be able to 'hide' pictures that you'd rather not see or were simply mistakes. I do understand why they choose to take in EVERY photo, but a 'hidden' folder would reduce the volume of pics to scroll through that are bad.Still, very nice work."
8/17/2013,US,5,Lelelele1978,2.0.5,Excellent app,"Beautiful, innovative, love the flashback section!"
8/17/2013,US,5,Maxplatinum,2.0.4,Phenomenal,The best.  That's all you need to know.
8/17/2013,US,5,frankkkko,2.0.5,Love this app,I deactivated photo stream and icloud backup and i'm very satisfied with this solution.
8/17/2013,US,5,James Pamplin,2.0.5,Awesome,Exactly what I needed to help with photos spread across multiple machines and phones
8/17/2013,CA,4,iHater,2.0.5,Great app overall,Excellent app for backing up your photos.  I do wish that you could delete photos directly from the app.
8/16/2013,FR,5,sebastien beague,2.0.5,Très bien !,.
8/16/2013,AU,5,Whybird,2.0.5,I'm loving it,This service is finding photos I forgot I had. Nice work!

8/16/2013,US,5,westonotes,2.0.5,Easy & great.,Very useful.
8/16/2013,US,5,Thrilla Jay,2.0.5,Awesome!!!,I use this on every computer I own plus my 2 tablets and 2 smartphones.  It's hands down excellent
8/16/2013,US,5,dmichelr,2.0.5,Best photo backup app ever!,"I've tried a lot of options for backing up our 20,000+ photos on our computer and iPhones, and this one is by far the best!  Backs up everything in background, removes duplicates, fool proof!  Worth every penny for the subscription."
8/16/2013,CA,5,Far,2.0.5,This changes everything,I now have access to years of photos from everywhere. Thanks for liberating my photo collection!
8/15/2013,US,5,Jzn99,2.0.4,perfect,"I love this app! it's awesome! I feel a lot safer with my photos now, the only thing I wish was changed was the fact they you can't import photo stream or any other photo albums from your phone. otherwise though, this is a great app! I think everyone should get it"
8/15/2013,US,3,Frustated zynga poker player,2.0.4,"Great service, decent app","While I am happy with Everpix overall, I can't give this app 5 stars until it supports basic functionalities like:- deleting a photo- a slideshow mode.Other items on my wish list:- Photo organization abilities (into albums etc)- slideshows with support to stream to a Apple TV and a Google Chromecast- Photo metadata editing, such as the date or location"
8/15/2013,IT,5,Lucaslawyer,2.0.2,Fantastica!,L'app definitiva per la condivisione di foto e pure gratuita!! 10 e lode
8/15/2013,US,5,heman8400,2.0.4,Exactly what I wanted,"Upload pictures, and make them viewable everywhere? I'll be getting the unlimited subscription soon (through the website) because this is how the cloud is supposed to work with pictures."
8/14/2013,GB,4,acetuk,2.0.4,Great fun,"I'm loving this app. Being able to see lots of my old photos and have the app find highlights for me is great fun.Things I would like to see -Being able to flag favourites for easy finding later.Simple tagging so I can add appropriate names, places etc.Being able to delete photos I don't want to see in my collection.Other than that this is a great service and one I will continue to use for quite sometime."
8/14/2013,AU,4,Billy Badgee,2.0.4,Brilliant,"An excellent way to get all those photos in one place, where you'll actually look at them. Nice Flashback feature lets you see what you were up to on that day back through the years. Maybe a Places filter would be a nice add."
8/14/2013,SG,5,kenlimkenlim,2.0.4,Wonderful photo organisation,"A great way to organise, save and view my photos."
8/14/2013,US,5,nickhnry,2.0.4,Such a wonderful service!,Great solution to backing up all my photos easily.
8/14/2013,US,5,Mikeraboy,2.0.4,Clever app,This app works really well and is very clever.  I get a notice to look at pics and there is a birthday party from two years ago.
8/14/2013,US,5,App junkie 3000,2.0.4,Good app!,"I had some other ""photo management"" app that, if you deleted the pictures from your camera roll, they also were deleted from the app.  What good is that?  I've only had this a couple of days, but it seems very good."
8/13/2013,US,4,Themattgorr,2.0.4,Almost there!,"Definitely a 5 star review in comparison to any other program, but I'm giving it 4 because its a work in progress with some of the more 'advanced' features like object recognition."
8/13/2013,CH,5,onecut,2.0.4,Works well,Almost Better than the website !
8/13/2013,FR,5,Orfalaise,2.0.4,Application bien pensée!,"J'ai découvert Everpix il y a un mois et ai souscrit à l'option payante.

8/13/2013,AU,5,ZacG,2.0.4,Couldn't be happier,"Literally all of your photos in one place. I now have over 22,000 photos from the last 15 years in Everpix, and can access any of them on any of my devices whenever I want. Well worth a look at if you've been wondering how to manage a large photo library and access it on your iPhone or iPad."
8/13/2013,JP,4,Gaijin obudupikin,2.0.4,Everpix,Great app lovely UI ...I wish videos too could be backed up along with the stills.fingers crossed!
8/12/2013,GB,3,markcwalk,2.0.4,I've been loving the flashbacks,"I've been loving the flashbacks, but the fact you don't seem able to delete photos is awful. Seems like such an obvious feature, but if it is currently a feature then it's well hidden!"
8/12/2013,US,1,Average Joe™,2.0.4,Not all images uploaded.,Everpix will only upload your images if it meets its criteria (see FAQ on website). Bought 1 yr subscription and started uploading 1000+ images. 100 weren't uploaded. No popup or info why they weren't uploaded. This is not an alternative to Dropbox. You have to manually check what has been uploaded before you delete from iPhone.
8/11/2013,PT,4,JoaquimRC,2.0.3,Excelent,"Uploaded 25000 pics, works wonderfully. Best: can jump to any of the 25000 in my iPhone! Flash back is really great, a source of joy for the family. Worst: no map overview like in iPhoto even throw the geolocation is there and maps shown in individual photos."
8/11/2013,DK,5,jedegn,2.0.4,Perfekt til deling af billeder,"Virkelig godt program til deling af billeder mellem flere brugere.Opload fra iPad, iPhone, PC, MAC.Flashback er super fint man for en mail hver dag der viser de billeder man tog for et to tre år tilbage i tiden."
8/11/2013,US,5,pcmhatre,2.0.4,Excellent photo archive,Love the ease of use. Pretty handy archive of all your photos on the go. The de-duplicating is an awesome feature. Highly recommend.
8/11/2013,US,5,A.Fruit,2.0.4,The missing iPhone app,"The way photos SHOULD be on the iPhone & Mac ecosystem. I'm dropping iPhoto as my main photo management tool, dropping Dropbox for cloud storage of photos, and turning off iCloud sync for photos. This app is all you need."
8/11/2013,CA,4,Amityone,2.0.4,"Simple, fast!",Everpix is a great was to backup photos and to always have them available on whatever I'm using at the time. It's what Photostream should be.
8/10/2013,FR,5,Neritea,2.0.3,Great App,"Easy, reliable, fast, well designed. It only lacks the ability to sync videos."
8/10/2013,US,5,Rater570,2.0.4,What Photostream should be,"Premium subscription worth every penny. Only request is that they offer more methods to automatically organize/filter photos (eg, 'places' or 'faces')"
8/9/2013,CH,5,Mensen,2.0.4,Great App!,Thank you Everpix for taking care of my pictures for me. I love the Flashbacks! Keep up improving your service :D

8/8/2013,US,4,dsecrest,2.0.3,Loving it!,No longer have to depend on iPhoto smart albums to organize photos by date. Just upload them and Everpix does the rest. Also LOVING the flashback feature.

8/7/2013,NO,5,picatta,2.0.3,Perfekt for familiebiler,Dette er den beste løsningen jeg har kommet over for å ha tilgang til familiebiler på en enkel måte. Hver dag finner app'n frem gamle bilder som nærmest er glemt. I tillegg er gir app'n en veldig lett og enkel måte å gå gjennom bildene dine på. Anbefales.

8/4/2013,US,5,Fazworld,2.0.3,Best photo organizing app,"I have used many photo managing applications, but Everpix is one of the best. It really makes the process of finding pictures easy, whether it's per year or photo type or whatever. And sharing pictures is a breeze."

8/3/2013,US,5,fozzieiam,2.0.3,Amazing,"Love it. Makes my life much easier when looking for a pic. When I want to share am image from my library no matter where I am I can find it online with my iPhone, iPad or computer. Thank you !"
8/3/2013,US,5,hwilke01,2.0.2,You won't be disappointed,Never lose another photo from your phone again.  And stop worrying about external disks.  This app and service is amazing and while not perfect (would be nice to pick photos from multiple days to make an 'event' or photo album) it still definitely doesn't disappoint. Excellent app and service.  There has been a need in the digital photo marketplace since smart phones first started taking pictures!

8/2/2013,FR,2,Yvan Teule,2.0.3,Joli mais quelle utilité ?,"Il s'agit d'une synchronisation en temps réel des photos qui sont sur son ordinateur dans le Cloud. C'est joliment présenté, mais on a pas le choix du classement. Les photos sont classées par événements qui correspondent à la date de leur création ou de leur téléchargement sur son ordinateur. En réalité ça ne correspond pas toujours à un événement mais cela on ne peut le changer. Et c'est bien une synchronisation. Ce qui veut dire que les photos supprimées sur son ordinateur sont aussi supprimées sur Everpix. À quoi cela sert-il ? Pour ma part, je préfère de très loin Flickr où l'on décide soi-même de ce qui doit y être ou pas. Et depuis la gratuité de Flickr pour 1 TOctet , y'a pas photo ! D'autant que si on réduit le poids des photos avec l'appli JPEGmini, 1 To c'est quasiment de l'illimité.YT"
8/2/2013,US,5,HunterKerhart,2.0.3,Amazing app!,"Just needs video support, and to fine tune the explore section."
8/1/2013,GB,4,Gadget Phil,2.0.2,Great app for the memory,"Is it perfect no, especially management of images your not happy with. The app has room to grow, but more importantly it has a place on your phone or iPad..."
8/1/2013,US,5,Phisher13,2.0.2,Awesome,Best photo storage app I have every found its like iPhoto but much much easier takes every photo I have close to 6000 and scrubs them in highlights and presents them by time in a very cool fashion. I can't say enough good things anyways keep up the good work Everpix cuz this app rocks..FYI works just as good on a windows pc Mac iPad or iPhone all if which I am using.
7/31/2013,GB,5,Raffles52,2.0.2,Great photo app,Does what it says! Great way of bringing pictures together. Very easy to use.

7/29/2013,AR,5,Lisandro M. Enrique,2.0.2,Great App for Photographers. Excelente aplicación para Fotógrafos.,"It's a great app with a hugh mount of details and things that make more easy the photographer life. It's simple, organized, clean and beautiful. And most of all, he way to share some pictures with your clients it's amazing. Forget about uploading photos to our FTP, or other kind of services, just point some folder, let Everpix do the rest, then share!Continue working guys! The only thing that I want it's the possibility to add trough Facebook all the Fan Pages from my fcbk account."
7/29/2013,CA,5,RedRabbit123,2.0.2,Great option for photo backup,"After dropping my external hard drive with my entire Aperture library on it and now paying $600 to get it back, I wanted to find an online backup option. I still have issues with storing ALL my photos on this companies servers but haven't seen anything in their TOS saying they own the photos or even have access to them. Works seamlessly in the background and all of my photos from my Mac and iPhone are on my account without me thinking about it. The Highlights and Flashback features are really nice to explore your photos and remember a lot of forgotten photos.Only real negative things things if suggest for improvement is to add the ability to delete or hide photos from inside the iOS app instead of only on the website. Also, when I hide photos, I should be able to view a ""Hidden"" folder or something where I can unhide individual photos."
7/28/2013,NZ,5,Fastred,2.0.2,Excellent and easy to use,"This app and the associated service are am excellent way to manage an increasingly large collection of electronic photos. Not only does it enable cloud backup, it makes exploring older photos a lot of fun. Highly recommended."
7/28/2013,GB,5,pmbonar,2.0.2,Thanks...,...its just awesome
7/28/2013,GB,4,Craig Beattie,2.0.2,Curious about semantic features,But the picture browsing is cool too!
7/28/2013,GB,4,The_Dr00,2.0.2,A real Life Saver,"Awesome service, fast syncing and a great price.I love that in addition to storing your pictures you get to view them and have them all so accessible, especially through features such as ""Flashback"".If they gave me the ability to delete photos from the app (and not just the website) this would be a 5 star product, no doubt."
7/28/2013,US,4,Bryan Parker,2,"Like it, judging it based on Beta standards","There are some bugs (animal pics just return random, flashbacks do not work on mobile), but the layout and initial experience is good."
7/27/2013,US,1,Xtnshun,2.0.2,Sorry I updated,"I should have learned by now.  When I try to explore ""food"" it crashes.  I've reset the iPad but it still does it,  so I would recommend holding off.The latest version syncs much better, is quicker in most cases but has increased the number of ""clicks"" to get to the things I use.  Plus I'm not sure the layout is better.I'm sure they'll improve things but it highlights to me how much a subscription service could be devalued with a bad redesign .Update: I've tried it for a couple of weeks and I have to say the UI isn't as good as the old version particularly on the iPhone.  They've mashed up the highlights and moments views and it just seems like a mess to me."
7/27/2013,US,5,EllisRichard,2.0.2,Like it,I actually like getting emails almost daily reminding me of pics I took years ago.  I email them to people in the pics or with me at the time I took them.
7/27/2013,CA,4,Tangster_01,2.0.2,Awesome and just getting better,"Great app/ service for keeping, remembering and sharing life in pictures. Love the flashbacks, so nice to be taken back in time weekly/ daily. And so easy to use too."

7/23/2013,GB,5,velvetD,2.0.1,Great,Nothing to fault with this app. Great for sharing photos and catching up withhold photos I'd forgotten about. Probably not so good for pictures you'd rather forget about.... But hey Ho.   :)
7/23/2013,US,5,gsiener,2.0.1,Great memories,Everpix captures all of your pictures and surfaces the best ones
7/22/2013,US,4,Harp395,2.0.1,Lots of fun and touching too,"Those moments from years back are always special to receive in my email. I do wish the app would also go into Shutterfly , where my old Kodak photos are or Picasa where I have many.  But an app well worth having."
7/22/2013,US,5,bradparnell,2.0.1,Finally.,"A great photo backup system, and my favorite feature is the daily emails I get of what photos I took 1 and 2 years ago on the same day."
7/21/2013,NL,5,marcogroen,2.0.1,Eindelijk!!,"Wat een geweldige tool! Eindelijk een goeie, cross platform cloud foto opslag die niet lastig of druk is.Naast een app voor de iPhone is er ook een super overzichtelijke website en een Mac app. Al mijn iPhoto foto's heb ik nu overal bij de hand. Ze staan overzichtelijk geordend op datum. Foto's staan keurig bij elkaar in wat men moments noemt. De weergave is modern en speels. Erg leuk!Foto's zijn per stuk of per ""moment"" in het originele formaat te downloaden. Zou nog graag zien dat ik mijn complete iPhoto library kan restoren als een soort cloud backup."

7/20/2013,US,5,James Brown,2.0.1,Great app and service,Great app and service - provides piece of mind to have my photos off-site.
7/18/2013,NL,4,Dirk en Herma,2.0.1,I enjoy my photos again,"I have uploaded my 22.000 photos from Aperture. Now I can enjoy them on iPad and other computers when I am on the move.Syncing works well: if I add locations later to some of my Aperture photos the new location shows up under Everpix.Sharing of photos has become straightforward and simple.The infrastructure seems to work well, I did not encounter any hassle. Everpix makes my photo life simpler.There remain some things to wish for.The iPad app has a slightly different functionality than the website. The app does not offer a list of the photo pages you have created.There is no way to select photos by location. Everpix does not take my ratings (the stars) into account. When a photo has different sources with conflicting locations, it only shows one.But these I consider mere glitches that in no way spoil the fun."

7/16/2013,US,5,Jvanhilten,2.0.1,Best photo app,"I have used Picasa  for a long time, but Everpix has convinced me to switch. Everpix ensures smooth syncing between your PCs, iPhone and iPad, unlimited back-up and I love how your pictures are organized by moments. Also good to know Everpix already has a revenue model (subscription) which is important to me before I trust my pictures to a business. Highly recommended!"

7/13/2013,US,5,Ozexpat,2.0.1,Perfect archiving and synching of all photos,"Everpix can take photos from every source, iPhoto, aperture, camera roll, text messages, folders on your computer and save them forever. You can easily select or deselect sources (important if you don't want to archive certain text photos ;) and everything is automatically uploaded without you having to think about it. It's so great to never have to say ""oh that photo is on my other [mac, iPhone, iPad] at home, sorry"" It's also a great photo backup tool. Very cheap for what it does. This is what iCloud photo should have been."
7/13/2013,US,5,ambimby,2.0.1,Say hello to your photo archives!,"Digital photography allows us to take so many images that it's easy to get overwhelmed by them all to the point that you forget even your best shots. Everpix saves your best shots from obscurity, highlighting them with flashbacks and other views so you can relive all those moments and love your massive photo library again. Get it."

7/9/2013,SE,4,franzstahl,2.0.1,Bra helhetstjänst,Om man som jag har 40000+ bilder så är det svårt att hålla koll på dem. Everpix gör ett ok jobb att sortera dem. Framförallt så finns dem i molnet och gör mig tryggare. Appen är riktigt bra och fungerar som jag förväntar mig att den borde.
7/9/2013,US,5,Alyssacritt,2,Everpix rules!,I love using this to keep track of all my photos - the daily flashback is super fun especially since I've installed it on my computer so I can even see six or seven years back! (:

Plus I'm not sure the layout is better.I'm sure they'll improve things but it highlights to me how much a subscription service could be devalued with a bad redesign .Update: I've tried it for a couple of weeks and I have to say the UI isn't as good as the old version particularly on the iPhone.  They've mashed up the highlights and moments views and it just seems like a mess to me."
7/9/2013,AU,5,Gambas fil-fil,2,Seriously good,"After just a day of playing around with the trial, I subscribed. So nice to be able to idly flick through a broad, yet quality selection from years worth of photos on any of my devices (phone, iPad, and through the web service on my media centre pc and mac at work). A slideshow function would be a wonderful addition, I could sit watching that for many hours."

7/5/2013,DE,5,... mir,2,Funktioniert,"Trotz nur 440kbs Upload dank meiner Leitung sind schon einige Hundert Bilder in der cloud und abrufbar Funktioniert soweit gut.+ Am AppleTV via AirPlay + Auf allen Geräten verfügbar (iPhone, Browser, appleTV)+ Ich kann Bilder teilen (ausgewählte natürlich)+ Schell und zuverlässig - leider recht wenig Einstellungen zwecks Verwaltung , alles wird automatisch verwaltet, geschoben und kategorisiert.. Kann man auch als Vorteil sehen.. Manuelle Korrekturen wären hier und da wünschenswert.- Die Erkennung von Gesichtern, Orten usw ist noch in der Entwicklung .Ist auf jeden Fall eine gute Alternative zum Photostream der nur die aktuellsten Bilder sichert und danach wieder rauswirft. Es ist ja ein recht junges Produkt.. Bei mir funktioniert es ohne Probleme - bisher zu mindest.."
7/5/2013,AU,5,We love Bumble bee,1.5.5,Awesome,The send random photo by email feature is amazing. Collage display and various sort features refreshing. I love it. Makes getting photo collections on various family phones very easy. No slide show feature yet but way more fun to use than built in photo albums in iOS 6.
7/4/2013,AU,4,zoby123,2,not on par with the web version,need the possibility to hide pictures from ipad. also would be nice to set more than 2gb cache

7/3/2013,GB,4,RTPeat,2,Some Obvious Bugs,"As a service Everpix is pretty good, allows me to rediscover old pictures, and also find particular pictures without having to carry them all around all the time.However there are some annoying bugs, in particular it is consistently a year out on pictures, for example today it is showing me a picture from July 3rd 2009 captioned as three years ago, and pictures from July 3rd 2005 as seven years ago. It's a simple but annoying bug that has been present in multiple versions and hasn't been fixed."
7/3/2013,DE,5,TheFriendInMe,2,Great App,The App ecosystem works great already (Mac+iPad+iPhone). The upload works great and fast.I very much like the feature where you are shown pictures from exactly one year ago. Finally I really do look at my old pictures.Looking forward to more features. (Deleting on iOS)
7/3/2013,CA,5,codegoat,2,We love it!,Love it. No more sifting through our 150+gig family history. Flashback is awesome. A daily dose of memories!
7/2/2013,US,5,Pondage,2,Much better....,Excellent now!  Thank you for this....just signed up...for photo storage this replaces them all...

6/30/2013,DE,1,cantosinviva,2,Everpix,"Nach mehreren Stunden (steht ja auch im Tutorial), sage und schreibe 1 Foto upgeloaded. Alle Fotos, die bereits chic in seperate Alben oder im Fotostream eingeordnet sind, wurden nicht berücksichtigt. Ich dachte, probiere mal etwas Neues, ein frisches UI.Aber wo soll denn der Reiz liegen, umzusteigen????"
6/30/2013,US,5,coolguy45,2,Better than Snapjoy,"I just moved our photo collection to everpix and have been very pleased. I was an avid snapjoy user until they shut service down. Although I did like the look of snapjoy timeline a bit better, the other features make everpix a winner!"
6/29/2013,IT,4,fabulousfabio,2,Grande sistema,"L'app va affinata, si nota che è una prima versione, ma il sistema è geniale per archiviare le foto, godersele in ogni momento e inviarle.Il sistema è gratuito per un anno di foto, se si vuole andare più indietro, bisogna pagare."
6/29/2013,BE,5,Kalakov,2,Best photo organizer and auto sync!!!,Everpix really is magic !
6/29/2013,GB,4,Matti Tapaninaho,2,"Great service, highly recommended!",Nice way of exposing older photos as well as ones taken on other cameras than the iPhone.
6/29/2013,US,2,Kadrey,2,"Two steps forward, three step back","The latest update has changed so much, and seems to have favored simplification over functionality.The good: transition animations and faster syncing.The bad:- The layout. I preferred the previous layout with different sized thumbnails. It seemed easier to navigate and more interesting:- The elimination of the Sources view. Why??? I keep my photographs organized into projects, and I enjoy revisiting my photos by project. For example, I want to be able to browse through all of the photos from a vacation, not just those from one day. This view is no longer even an option.- Over reliance on the moments view. Why??? I rarely used the moments view in the previous version.- Highlights is no longer the default view. I thought highlights were one of Everpix's primary benefits?Sorry, guys, but I prefer the previous version."
6/28/2013,FR,4,zeBooZ,2,Très pratique et très beau! Mais...,"J'enlève une étoile pour  la nouvelle version 2.0. Elle est apparemment moins rapide, le partage est moins pratique (toutes les photos sont sélectionnées même si on en veux qu'une partie). La version iPad plante lorsque l'on trie par source. Je trouve la présentation 'highlights' moins jolie (trop carrée)."
6/28/2013,KR,3,yeuyeu0326,2,Nice~,Nice~!!  like a Cymera Gallery. :D
6/28/2013,US,4,It's RICO!,2,"Great app, but","Everything works very well. The Explore feature (filter by animals, nature, people, etc) only works okay. But I love the rest. Very much expecting to pay for a subscription after the trial is done. It's so satisfying to know that all your photos on all your devices and computers are backed up and organized!One thing that is terribly frustrating is that you can not download multiple photos to my phone. You have to do it one at a time. Ugh lame! I wish I could download all the pics from an event at once, or at least ""save to camera roll"" as many photos as I select! Such a silly miss that continues in v2.0."
6/28/2013,US,5,Philippe Gauthier,2,Fantastic redesign,I love the direction this app is taking. Simplifying the app to make finding your photos easier and more intuitive. Can't wait to see what's next with everpix.
6/28/2013,US,4,iTunesfool,2,No delete? Why?,"I sometimes take pictures of circuit boards of cameras that I am repairing, I do NOT keep these pictures, and I don't want them synced to Everpix!  If pictures are synced, there is no way either from the app or from the web site.  Bad!CORRECTION!!!!!!There is a way to delete pictures from your account.  Must do it from the Everpix website.  There are specific instructions on how to do it in ""Frequently Asked Questions"".  I should have read the FAQ before commenting, update stars from 3 to 4."
6/28/2013,US,2,MCS technologies,2,Delete 👎,"There is no way to delete photos from this app, and the web interface only lets u delete 1 photo at a time.  This is a key feature - especially since photos and groups of photos get synced and and no way to delete them. Thumbs down. Boo !!"

6/28/2013,GB,5,jpsjsj,2,Awesome,"Awesome app, rediscovered so many old photos. So easy to use and it processes everything so quickly. Got my 30,000+ library in there very quickly!"
6/28/2013,US,1,jupebox,2,Delete.....,"You cannot delete photos.  If you could delete, it would be a 4.5 star app.  Without deleting, it is 1.5 in my book."
6/28/2013,US,1,krish0808,2,Can't get in,"I downloaded the app, signed up. It told me to check email. I did and hit ""complete signup"" but it took me to a page where again I had to type in my email. That again asked me to check email. Frustrated, I deleted app. It is about the first impression."
6/28/2013,US,2,instanttim,2,Loved old UI!,"I do not like the new UI and organization of the photos. The old way was more attractive and easier to find things when I knew the month. I like some of the changes like easy access to the ""flashback"" and combining sources, moments, and highlights. But the presentation is a step backwards!"
6/28/2013,US,5,Shaman Moon,2,Sigh...no longer works,"After updating to the newest version, this app no longer works on my iPad2. It starts to open then immediately closes. Wish there was a way to downgrade."

6/28/2013,US,4,Travis Wu,2,Non-stop,It's just getting better non-stop.  This is the first paid photo hosting / discovery service I'm using and I would recommend this highly!  They fine tune all features at all time made it faster and easier to use.
6/27/2013,SE,4,berntm,1.5.5,Det alla bildslarvrar behöver,"Jag har bilder i min Mac, iphone, Picasa, Flickr m fl ställen.

6/27/2013,GB,3,JackSlash,2,It just got harder,The app doesn't rotate and now the explore feature is hidden away and hard to find. This update feels like a step backward.

6/27/2013,US,5,Kadrey,1.5.5,I love it,"Everpix has changed how my iOS devices and photographs interact. No longer do I need to worry about syncing different Aperture projects or albums to my iOS devices before the fact. Instead, the Everpix apps allow me to access all of my photos at any time from any of my iOS devices, as long as I have an Internet connection.Perhaps more importantly, Everpix has created an online, off-site copy of my entire photograph collection--around 4,400 total. I don't know if I would consider this a backup, as a local app on my iMac constantly syncs with my Aperture library. Still, knowing that I have my photos in one more place lifts some worry.Finally, Everpix has helped me rediscover old photos and events by sending me daily memory emails. Everpix picks a couple of photos from a random moment in my collection and emails them to me every morning. Fun! Sometimes I forward these emails to friends or family members who might like seeing them, which has led to some enjoyable conversations.All in all, I have enjoyed this service, and plan on resubscribing when my current subscription expires.One thing I would like to see: a portrait view in the iPad app."
6/27/2013,CA,4,SMG199,2,Disappointed,"I have a paid subscription to Everpix and I thought it was great until the new update. We no longer get the source view which made it easier to find pics through named folders. With 35000+ photos over 13 years, only having dates makes it difficult to find specific trips, for example."
6/27/2013,CA,5,SueBeee4,2,Amazing,"This app is in my Top 3. The best way to peruse your pictures, to share with others, and to re-discover pictures you forgot you had."
6/26/2013,US,5,Soyaspade,1.5.5,Fantastic App,I love the ease of sharing photos and auto syncing photos from my phone.
6/25/2013,US,5,Mikepollock,1.5.5,Great,"This works exceptionally well. My only issue was I didn't set the date in my camera back in 2000, so my pictures showed a 1969 default date. I had to go in and adjust the exif date, which was kind if a pain to find software that would do it, but shootshifter worked great for that.  A few suggestions I would make:1) allow user to add comments into the jog. There are fields that would be great if we could add, and them search for this key words. 2) do the same thing for movies! I have a ton if movies that I have taken over the years and would love to find a service that does the same thing!Very happy with this service. I have about 24k pictures now stored on everpix. The speed that my iPhone 4s is able to access the pictures is amazing! Those that have LTE will be blown away. Plus the interface with Apple TV, it is great.  Again, add video, an this would be almost perfect."

6/14/2013,US,3,sternchocolates,1.5.5,Some good some bad,"I like how quickly it vacuums up all my photos. But I hate that I can't delete photos in everpix and have them deleted everywhere. and it seems that even when I delete photos from sources everpix is using, they don't dissappear in everpix. also would like to be abl to just simply scroll through all my photos like cameraroll. I don't like that it automatically selects and categorizes as it's not very accurate, i have hundreds of food and chocolate pictures, and none of them appear in the food section of everpix."

6/11/2013,US,3,os4,1.5.5,Great (but huge caveat),"The service is fantastic, being able to consolidate photos from all of my devices. Everything is automatic. Wonderful to see all our family's photos in one place. The big downside is that Everpix does not want to consider itself a backup solution. Given that this is now the one place all of our photos are, the company's attitude highlights how fragile the value is in the service. If I can't stop worrying about the backup of my photos, Everpix becomes a huge liability."
6/10/2013,US,5,MattCampy,1.5.5,Great Photo Sharing App,"Everpix provides me a simple solution to sharing my library of over 30,000 photos with anyone I want. It's a very slick solution to the inaccessible external hard drive."
6/9/2013,US,5,Shravan Kumar n,1.5.5,Good app ...,I have few suggestions:1. Wish there is scope for tagging and organising pictures into folders like in Picasa and Flicker. 2. Wish there is scope to include a comment for picture or folder. Apart from these two I feel this is the best image backup and organising app ever on AppStore. Great idea and great initiative - keep it up guys.
6/8/2013,US,5,PolishManiak,1.5.5,Very slick,Super easy to set up and use.  Takes some time for your images to be processed but a great tool to back up and organize your photos across devices!

6/7/2013,US,5,Flipuser,1.5.5,"200,000+ Photos...Love it.","Everpix is awesome. Our family is discovering photos (""moments"") which we had forgotten. There's been several nights recently where we sit around the computer pushing the ""Randomizer"" button to see what photos Everpix will decide to display!  We truly have over 200,000 pics uploaded from many years of family photos (yes, we take lots).  Took a week to fully upload.  I have catalogs by year in Adobe Lightroom but find that it's much quicker to locate a ""moment"" by searching Everpix, especially if I am unsure of the exact time.  It's also great to have access to all photos anytime/anywhere from my iPhone!"

5/24/2013,CA,5,Bad Robot,1.5.5,The Photo App for the Cloud Age,"At first blush, this app doesn't seem to be anything special. Its strengths are subtle. It seems to be just another cloud-photo app. But then you begin to realize that it can sync content from multiple sources. And not just sync, but resolve conflicts and recognize duplicates. Then you notice it will sync up with changes you make in your iPhoto library, or on Google Plus. It reveals itself in layers, as you use it, and slowly grows to become the core of your photo management routine, linking multiple disparate sources together into a cohesive whole. Sure, it has shortcomings. Like, you can't add comments to photos or invite others to comment on them. Hopefully those things will be sorted out in the long term. As it stands, though, this little app is mighty indeed, and well worth your consideration."
5/24/2013,CA,4,Seedublyew,1.5.5,Great Service!,"Uploaded over 40,000 pictures that were on a backup HD but rarely viewed but now can see them all and sync between 3 iOS devices and MacBookAir. Wish the iOS app had the ability to hide or delete pictures, and that images could be rated in order to give them preference to be displayed in the curated views. Otherwise extremely happy!"

5/23/2013,US,5,Gregory Jones,1.5.5,Terrific,Everpix slurped up my large aperture library in record time and lets me see my pictures on my iPhone and iPad anytime - even offline. It's exactly what I want from a cloud backup. The icing on the cake is the intelligent analysis and the cool ways to explore pictures you forgot you even had.

I just wish I could hide pictures from my phone and that I could scroll through all my pictures in one place... Kinda like how you scroll through pictures in your camera roll. It would also be nice to be able to create folders to save pictures in. Other than that... I love it!!
5/21/2013,CA,5,NKMISGOD,1.5.3,Great,I love the app.  It does what it promises.I hope they take it to the next level.  Here is what I would live to see1).  Same thing but for all my iPhone movie clips2) face recognition like iPhoto. The experimental stuff in current version is not to good but it is totally co and I'd live to search by a face or something.3) integrate with MS office and iMovie and other MS and Mac apps so pics can be dragged off it right into the app or slideshow rather than needing to download them first to a folder 4) add photo editing SW
5/20/2013,GB,5,Blarmski,1.5.5,Love it love it love it,"Spent years with lovely photos all over the place, tons of duplicates, really difficult to make any sense of.

Remarkably good at using all the screen real estate that is available on a specific device. Especially great viewing on an iPad. Also, this apps ability to automatically mirror an iPhoto or an Aperture project is remarkable and very useful.The thumbnail layouts can be a little cute as opposed useful - sometimes the thumbnail crops are just odd. Everpix continues to try and develop algorithms for identifying meta groups within collections but to date these are most often useless.With the display of additional metadata Everpix is an important part of my photographic workflow. The best current platform is the iPad. Great app."

4/20/2013,US,2,MedStudentI,1.5.3,Not complete syncing!,"It is nice that it puts all your pictures from various sources into one place, but the problem is, that one place is on Everpix servers and they do not allow you to download-snyc those photos to a folder on your computer. So when you take pictures with your phone the files are simply on your phone and in their servers (""the cloud""). The Mac app will only upload files stored on your computer to the cloud, but it will not download any new photos taken from your phone that are in the cloud. I don't see why they wouldn't give us the capability to actually sync folders across devices like Google Drive or Dropbox. In order to get those pictures onto your computer you have to go to their website and download them… and the file names when downloaded are just random letters generated, and there isn't an easy ""one-click download all"". For example, it appears you can only download a Day of photos at once. And then you get this message, ""It may take several minutes to prepare these 3 photos for download. You will receive a download link via email when your photos are ready."" Several minutes, for 3 photos… and you email me a download link,  and the photos  have files names of ""njfnwsejnofocaiweofhncclofiwehnglr.jpg""?"

Le jonglage est quasi-quotidien entre les disques durs, le NAS, les différents postes de travail (maison, bureau, portable) pour sauvegarder et gérer cette collection.Avec Everpix, la visualisation de ces images, et donc la navigation au milieu de 25 ans de souvenirs familiaux ou non, devient facile, rapide et sans nécessiter de maîtrise des outils logiciels lourds. Tout le monde adore : les enfants, mon épouse, mes copains, et moi aussi car je redécouvre des clichés oubliés.Le mode ""highlights"" est plutôt pertinent dans la sélection des images forces, même s'il reste perfectible.Le mode ""explore"" est anecdotique à mon avis.Plusieurs regrets que des évolutions futures corrigeront je l'espère :1/ pas de recherche par mot clé ou code IPTC...2/ une même clé USB (ou disque dur) synchronisée sur des ordinateurs différents sera vue comme autant de sources différentes et ne fera que créer des doublons... Dommage à l'ère de la mobilité...3/ impossibilité d'exclure un répertoire, un événement ou un cliché  au sein d'une synchronisation à partir d'iPhoto ou de Lightroom. Certaines photos doivent donc préalablement être retirées de la photothèque afin de conserver leur caractère privée (photo de nus ou photos chirurgicales professionnelles ne devant pas tombées sous les yeux des enfants...)4/ dernier point : la synchro des fichiers bruts RAW ferait d'Everpix un formidable outil de sauvegarde, pour ceux possédant une ligne synchrone à haut débit ascendant et descendant.Photographes amateurs ou non, essayez ce service et vous serez conquis.Bravo aux concepteurs.Olivier"

Mais on ne peut pas s'en servir comme service de sauvegarde.plein de pub: évier prix fait du marketing viral quand on envoie ses photos privées par mail. Et ce meme quand on paie 40€ par an.

3/26/2013,US,4,hellosoymaria,1.5.1,Quite happy,"I like how fast everything is organized. I miss tags or favorite pictures, but still is the best photo app I've seen. Very easy to use. I went premium because I really liked the free version."

I have universal access to all pictures everywhere. I can quickly build webpages full of photos (well designed and clickable to full screen) and send links to them.     For $40 a year I have a full online backup, a better than Flickr web interface, and instant updating as new photos are taken from iPhone or downloaded from camera to iPhoto. That is a five star app."

3/23/2013,US,2,Xtnshun,1.5.1,Pretty good,"This is a pretty good app.  Combines photos from lots of places, and resurfaces old ones in interesting ways.  Downsides are no portrait mode on iPad and it nags you to rate it."
3/21/2013,DK,4,Igor123444,1.5.1,...,Love that I can have all my photos synced in one place! Has a great and intriguing UI. Very easy to use...Would like to have a feature where I would be able to download all my photos though. Also filtering on sources is missing in the app...

3/19/2013,GB,5,Toytown Mafia,1.5.1,Rediscover your photo collection,"I'm so pleased that this service exists. I haven't looked at my photo collection for months, since it's stuck in iPhoto on my Mac, which I don't use as much any more.Everpix makes your photo collection more accessible through the apps, it makes it more complete through the Facebook and other connections, and makes it more enjoyable through features like Explore.It's reassuring that everything's backed up in the cloud, and that you have to pay, so it's not going to disappear overnight. There seem to be weekly updates too.The only things really missing at the moment are a map view based on geolocation data, and being able to see information about photos, like you can on the website. I'm sure these features are in the works."
3/18/2013,IT,5,Parú,1.5.1,Ottima e finalmente anche freemium,"Grafica curata e servizio molto ben fatto, introdotta da poco la versione per poveri, per fortuna. Ottima app. Problemi con l'icona su iPod touch"
3/18/2013,US,4,Dignanmorse,1.5.1,"Great app, but not for me","This is a really well done app, and a good service. However, the lack of some key features will keep me looking elsewhere. The thing I miss most is the ability to have communal albums that myself and family and friends can all contribute to. Instead this service only allows you to share in one direction."
3/18/2013,US,5,Christopher Brandow,1.5.1,Simply amazing,Really easy to set up. Makes me sigh an enormous sigh of relief. Will definitely be upgrading to paid version.
3/17/2013,GR,5,fedlivie,1.5.1,An Awesome App!,This elegantly designed app is an indispensable tool for those who enjoy revisiting their large collections of old photos which were previously scattered into several long abandoned hard drives and mobile phones.  Everpix allows these photo collections to be gathered into one place (in the cloud) which is readily accessible from everywhere.
3/17/2013,US,5,DaddyFlo,1.5.1,"Wow, finally getting my digital photos organized...","I have over 100,000 photos that I've scanned, shot, downloaded, been sent and prudently copied on many hard drives over the past dozen years.  By design I have many copies of of the same file on many hard drive and in many folders. While over the years this has insured that I wouldn't lose all my photos in case of failure or fire, It has been impossible to organize. Everpix appears to be on the path to solving this problem. I gave it five stars, not because I rate it a perfect service, but because it appears to be a great beginning  with GREAT potential down the line. It has allowed me to transform my photographic ""trash house"" so that I can at least walk around now. In the future I hope to throw away what is not needed and have it cleaned up enough to invite friends in to enjoy.Thanks for the solution.  Keep up the good work."

3/14/2013,US,1,Disgruntled Slate Reader,1.5,Not sure Everview knows anything,"Not sure thar Everview knows anything. I have several dozen pictures of head and shoulder shots of people that Everview has indexed. When I ask for people, ""no images"" are reported. As a matter of fact, I have no images in any of the Everview categories. Just the collection, lumped in some sort of date quanta. Bottom line: wait for version 2.0. Or maybe even 3.0."
3/14/2013,CA,5,keithy-boy,1.5,Wow-great idea,I lost a bunch of old photos recently and went looking for a way to save them into the cloud. This is an excellent Idea. It syncs devices and  my computers with a fantastic UI.

3/10/2013,US,4,hellosoymaria,1.5,Quite happy,"I have always been obsessed about the lack of a good app for organizing pictures. I think this has a good chance to be the one. It's quite fast in putting it all together and has a nice, easy design. I just miss a tag system or search tool to find pics. And maybe a way to favorite some of them. But I think improvements are coming. I have been trying several options and this is the best one!"
3/10/2013,FR,4,expressphotoKdo,1.5,Presque excellent,"Il ne manque que la possibilité de pouvoir effacer par lot et je mets une 5eme étoile. Pour le moment c'est déjà pas mal du tout. Au début c'est un peu perturbant car il y a un décalage entre la mise en ligne et l'affichage (dans le cas de nombreuses images en HD mises en ligne en même temps) tout comme un effacement total où il faut attendre plusieurs heures avant de voir les photos disparaitre mais une fois qu'on le sais, y à plus de Stress !"

3/6/2013,US,4,554228,1.5,Very Good,"The app does what it should - easy navigation, easy access. I don't like a few things:(1) Dates are all equally ""weighted"" such that if you take one throw away iPhone photo on a given day, when you're browsing, you have to look at that in the same way you would your 50 high-quality images from another day(2) I don't like having to click twice to see an enlarged image if there just one moment for a given dayThey also need to have actual facial recognition similar to ThisLife and tagging."

2/8/2013,US,5,TekkenFan,1.4.3,Good but could be great,Update:  the app has been updated.  Is now very stable.  So it is a 5 star app now. The cloud service is great.  Accessing all you pics via a mobile device is awesome.  The only two things keeping everpix from 5 stars is the instability of the iOS app (not a deal breaker) and the lack of auto rotate for the pics.

As well I wanted control over sharing and this is Everpix's default setting - social sharing of photos with very person out there that I know is not what I want for my personal photos. I also am totally impressed with the self loading functions at the heart of the application - no more manual uploading!!!!  So, it will be goodbye to my Flickr account very soon.The team is on a winner here and I have been talking it up with my contacts and other family members."

Just subscribe and stop dilly-dallying!Everpix is storing and organizing 100,000+ pics of my family memories, and we are amazingly pleased at the result - keep up the good work, Everpix team, and keep adding features!"

Not only is Everpix affordable, but for the first time I can actually browse through my huge personal photo library.  It brings a smile every time I swipe through photos of my son from when he was small.  Congrats and thank you to the Everpix team."
1/25/2013,CA,5,codegoat,1.4.3,Great,It is so awesome to enjoy your photo library from anywhere and to share with others. I am also confident in the Everpix team to improve the feature set moving forward. Great job!

I basically found I didn't have the time to upload and tag my photos, create and organize sets in Flickr, life just kept getting in the way... now all my photos sync automagically to the cloud (from desktop and iDevices), my wife and I can access them on our iDevices or via the web, and we can share in several ways!  It's freakin' BRILLIANT!Everpix is a great start to a solution that I have been looking / waiting for for a long, long time!  And it's FREE - give it a try!Here are the only two bugs / limitations I have found thusfar:1. Uploaded photos take awhile to show up (might be their servers getting slammed, might be the way they scan the photos to do everything they offer).2. There's no way (that I have found) to move photos in the Sources section. If you have moved photos around on your desktop, you have to delete the source and re-sync it... which ain't the greatest solution.THANK YOU FOR AN AWESOME SERVICE AND GREAT IOS APP!"

1/14/2013,US,4,TekkenFan,1.4.1,Good but could be great,The cloud service is great.  Accessing all you pics via a mobile device is awesome.  The only two things keeping everpix from 5 stars is the instability of the iOS app (not a deal breaker) and the lack of auto rotate for the pics.
1/13/2013,GB,5,Marcus Liberman,1.4.1,Lovely service and good looking app,"I have used this to get the 47,000+ photos from our Mac up onto the internet (it took a while!) and love the way it puts them together. It has got me delving into all sorts of old pics and events and emailing them to loved ones. Like a photo treasure trove opened up."
1/13/2013,US,4,GrumpyTechie,1.4.1,Outstanding,"Great way to take tens of thousands of pictures and organize them into a user friendly presentation mode.  Because of the presentation method I have spent hours reviewing and enjoying photos that I probably would never have looked at again.  It is very fast at getting the pictures uploaded, but it does take awhile to get GB's of data uploaded.  I have noted a few bugs but that is to be expected with software this complicated. Good job to the developers!"

Why don't people delete the unwanted as they go? Everpix has saved me the pain of removing duplicates (it's done automatically!), selecting the best quality images (hours of my time!) and then presents my entire life beautifully. Such a brilliant idea and has revolutionised the iPhoto bulge that just wasn't going to be solved easily. Subscribed for life!"

12/23/2012,GB,2,Thomas Goskar,1.2.2,No descriptions for photos,"I tried Everpix and this app and was disappointed to find out that there is no way of describing your photos at all. No titles, no descriptions, no tags. That means lost memories to me. With a real photo you can write on the back in pencil and future generations will know where and who is in the scene. This is pretty fundamental, and should be for a service that claims to be a place to archive all one's photos. While this app works as advertised, the overall Everpix service is a huge letdown with regard user-added metadata."

10/4/2012,US,3,George Kaplin,1.2.3,Very good but needs PC sync,I'm confident this app will continue to grow and get better. But right now it won't sync photos on your PC. Which is where most of my photos live! It will sync with a Mac though. That just doesn't help 95% of us. Also does not allow manual sorting which is odd. But the sorting and cataloging algorithms used sometimes make mistakes and there is no way to correct them. Kudos to including Picasa web albums.

6/30/2012,US,3,Cheburashka7,1.1,Needs work... But good app,"No delete option. Doesn't upload photos I save from received text msgs, uploads only the photos I take. Doesn't upload photos taken with other apps like instagram. I like it because it automatically saves ur photos and categorizes by date."

6/16/2012,NL,5,marcogroen,1.1,Eindelijk!!,"Wat een geweldige tool! Eindelijk een goeie, cross platform cloud foto opslag die niet lastig of druk is.Naast een app voor de iPhone is er ook een super overzichtelijke website en een Mac app. Al mijn iPhoto foto's heb ik nu overal bij de hand. Ze staan overzichtelijk geordend op datum. Foto's staan keurig bij elkaar in wat men moments noemt. De weergave is modern en speels. Erg leuk!Foto's zijn per stuk of per ""moment"" in het originele formaat te downloaden. Zou nog graag zien dat ik mijn complete iPhoto library kan restoren als een soort cloud backup."
6/16/2012,FR,5,kdorham,1.1,Awesome!,Ultimate backup service for your pics! Using it over all families phones with the same account so that every one get access to our pics while backing up new ones.

6/15/2012,PL,4,Śrub,1.1,Bardzo dobre,Nowa wersja lepsza od poprzedniej. Dobre jeśli potrzebujesz dodatkowego Backupu z opcją dzielenia się zdjęciami. A narazie brak limitu zdjęć (ok 3k już zamieszczone - następne w drodze).

6/13/2012,ES,4,Almarma,1.1,Copia de seguridad con estilo,"Es una aplicación fantástica para mantener una copia de seguridad de las fotos de tu equipo en la nube, así como para unificar servicios como instagram, Facebook o Picasa en un solo lugar. Para ser perfecto para mi, le falta la posibilidad de insertar una foto o un grupo en una web, y almacenar video, aunque esto entiendo que es una locura"
6/13/2012,US,4,Robert Malovec,1.1,Best photo organizer on market,"..just one negative thing - no iPad version. Everpix would feel so good on iPad, please add iPad support."
6/12/2012,NL,4,jeroen ketting,1.1,Mooi,Mooi en handige app ziet er goed uit. Alleen jammer dat je niet per foto kan verwijderen.

4/9/2012,PH,5,Jabbajed,1.0.2,Best Alternative available,Quick and easy app. Best substitute for icloud's photo stream. Saves the photo quality.
3/17/2012,ES,5,Jon Jiménez,1.0.2,Se cierra sola,Con la ultima actualización ya no se cierra. Veremos qué nuevas características implementan en futuras versiones
3/12/2012,GB,5,adam meek,1.0.2,Great app. For free!!,Can't praise this highly enough. It does crash when trying to sync large albums so the first time you do it you might find you have to do it three or four times but once it's done you open it up every now n then and sync pictures from the last week or so it is fine. Plus you can publish a whole album to Facebook as well.
3/8/2012,CA,5,Meaculpaz,1.0.2,Great app,Can't sync up your Facebook photos from your iPhone app but amazing nonetheless.
3/6/2012,US,5,Sylvain Briant,1.0.2,love it,Absolument géniale. permet d'avoir en une application l'ensemble des ses photos. Adoptée!.. Read all my reviews on crosswa.lk ..
3/2/2012,HU,5,OHeni,1.0.1,Szuper!,"De lehetne gyorsabb! Igaz az én telefonomon kb.1000 fotó van, de már 2.napja tölti fel és még nem végzett. Megelőlegezem az 5 csillagot, hátha utána a napi 5-10 fotóval gyorsabban elbír:)Hasznos lenne, ha lehetne törölni is a feltöltött képek közül egyesével is!UPDATEIt's a very good application. It's slow a little bit. It will be better, if I could delete only one picture of the uploaded pictures."
3/1/2012,HU,4,arqiveD,1.0.1,Gyönyörű,"Az ötlet nem új, de a megvalósítás gyönyörű. Sajnos azonban a túl sok képet nem bírja kezelni az app (a Mac-emről kb. 10.000 képet töltöttem fel a felhőbe) és pár másodperc után kidob. Majd talán a frissítés után 5 csillagos lesz."
2/29/2012,HU,4,arqiveD,1.0.1,Gyönyörű,"Az ötlet nem új, de a megvalósítás gyönyörű. Sajnos azonban még rendszeresen kilép. Majd a frissítés..."

2/26/2012,US,4,Eärendil7,1.0.1,App has significantly improved.,"The app used to crash almost immediately after opening it, but they seemed to have recently fixed the issue server-side.  I opened it today and it rebuilt my library and hasn't crashed yet.  My one issue is that I can't share a photo via email.  I don't use Facebook or Twitter.  Thanks for the improvements!!"
2/24/2012,PL,4,Śrub,1.0.1,Bardzo dobre,...zastępstwo dla strumienia zdjęć. jak narazie niezle.

2/18/2012,GB,1,Good Morning General,1.0.1,Lame - to register,Need to register first to try? Give us a break. So this is the review I would give.
2/17/2012,CH,5,Rakham le rouge,1.0.1,Excellent idea,Excellent idea
2/17/2012,GB,1,Louden73,1.0.1,"Great app, but keeps crashing","It took a long time to sync the photos, then it looked great for all of an hour. Now it keeps crashing every time it's opened. Love the idea but please fix the crashing."

2/17/2012,US,1,Eärendil7,1.0.1,"Theoretically awesome, but...",The app crashes almost immediately after opening it.
2/16/2012,IN,4,aakash159,1.0.1,Everpix,Best way to see your pics😃
2/15/2012,FR,3,Tavax,1.0.1,Great app but...,"Hum everpix fonctionnait bien puis comme il peut seulement récupérer les photos de mon FB ou je suis taggué, soit c'est débile mais ok.Je me taggue et à présent l'application se lance et se ferme aussitôt !Le prob apparaît suite à mon changement depuis FB mobile, étrange si les deux sont liés.Bref, bonne appli en beta test en tout cas, bon taf les mecs :)"
2/14/2012,US,2,Proceeding Hairline,1.0.1,Not sure I understand the value,"So, I have pictures on my phone I can look at anytime. I upload them to Everpix, and it sorts them by date. So, how is that different?  If I delete them from my phone, they delete from Everpix. I can already share pics to Facebook and Twitter. Again, what's the value here?"
2/14/2012,US,1,xokat143,1.0.1,Crashes!,"Worked fine for a couple times after I downloaded it. Now every time I open the app, it just crashes! Please fix."

2/13/2012,GB,1,ZacWoods,1.0.1,Would have been ok but...,"When you first download and install the app, you have to wait ages for your photos to upload, and you can't even multitask and use other apps. Uploading photos to the Everpix server requires you to sit and wait for the images to upload without doing anything."
2/12/2012,HU,5,Timcso,1.0.1,Tetszik,"Tetszik, tetszik és szeretem! ;) 👍"
2/11/2012,US,2,congge,1.0.1,Useful service but crashes all the time,Service is great with potential. If well implemented

2/11/2012,AU,5,Damian Caruana,1.0.1,Fantastic!,"Everpix is fantastic - all your online photos in one place, all the time. I've been using it since it was in Beta, and the only thing that lets it down is that it doesn't hurry to upload everything. An almost perfect service."
2/10/2012,RU,4,fatusik,1.0.1,Not bad,Хотелось бы иметь возможность сохранять фотки в телефон.
2/10/2012,US,5,DahveedGR,1.0.1,Best way to catalog life,"I am avid user of Aperture, iCloud Photo Stream, Flickr, Instagram, Facebook Timeline, etc... And in terms of previewing my photographic life, Everpix is the best solution I have enjoyed."
2/9/2012,US,5,GritsTx,1.0.1,Love it!,"Found this app in an article I read and its actually pretty awesome. Organizes your photos by date, which has been the best idea I've seen. Highly recommended. One of the best apps you can download."
2/7/2012,GB,1,James Buckingham,1.0.1,Doesn't Sync,"No matter if I'm on wifi or 3G, all the app does is continually try to sync my camera roll, but it doesn't work. I've tried leaving it for hours, but not a single photo uploads.Fix this, & the app would be a great iCloud replacement that doesn't have the 30 day limit."
2/7/2012,DE,2,Rainer Neugebauer,1.0.1,"Nice idea, but ...","... but what do I do with a bunch of my photos that are nicely organized but totally unusable because of incredibly reduced resolution?Not usable for viewing, not for archiving ...Make resolution user selectable, and retain the original file names and metadata, then this will be a 5 star app!"
2/7/2012,US,1,Fitzaer,1.0.1,Can't sign up.,Can't sign in. Neverpix.
2/6/2012,IT,5,fdangeloal,1.0.1,ottima app!,"davvero una buona gestione delle foto e la sincronizzazione anche se un po lenta di molte foto e da piu device, app e social network il tutto con un design avvincente! complimenti davvero"
2/6/2012,GB,4,Andy Dorrat,1.0.1,Great app - just what is needed,"Does everything picassa Flickr etc should do,...all the uploads go on in the background from my mac and my entire library will soon be viewable and shareable online. Would be good to know pricing structure and size limits....this is just the beta but I would be disappointed if I upload loads of pics and discover a premium account is either too pricey or the size is too limited....this has the potential to be the best photo storing options out there"
2/5/2012,ES,3,Jon Jiménez,1.0.1,Se cierra sola,Veremos si se soluciona con una actualización :)
2/5/2012,ES,4,Igor Morquecho,1.0.1,Beautiful app but...,Beautiful app but from few days ago I can't see my uploaded photos from Mac. Any ideas?
2/5/2012,NL,2,TheDude1991,1.0.1,Crashed continue,Ik heb net al mijn foto's geupload! Probeer ik de app weer te openen blijft hij crashen! SLECHT!!!! Fix het! Voor de rest ziet het er goed uit! Enige wat mist is het handmatig kunnen wissen van enkele foto's
2/5/2012,US,1,PRC.,1.0.1,Won't even let me sign up,"I think I saw this on TechCrunch.  I'd like to give this a fair review, but it doesn't let me sign up because of my email address.  What's it got against Gmail?"
2/5/2012,US,4,Aaron Soderholm,1.0.1,All your photos in your pocket,This is what Photostream should've been. With iTunes Match I have all my songs in my pocket and now with Everpix I have all my photos. Just awesome. 4 stars because the iOS app is a tiny bit buggy and you should be able to link your Facebook and Twitter accounts without using a computer.
2/4/2012,AR,1,Siriux,1.0.1,Doesn't work,At all
2/4/2012,US,1,shelby castile,1.0.1,Would be cool but doesn't work,It doesn't download any of my pics.Blank screen on both iPad 2 and I phone 4s. Maybe I'm doing something wrong ?
2/3/2012,BR,3,Rafa Marrone,1.0.1,Muito bom.,Faltam algumas coisas. Acredito que exportar para outros serviços e para o próprio iPhone seria perfeito. Assim o Everpix se tornaria um hub para você passar as fotos de um serviço para outro e também como atalho para compartilhamento.
2/3/2012,CN,4,renren_1101,1.0.1,好,确实方便
2/3/2012,FR,3,Eyll,1.0.1,Not finished yet,"Great concept, great app but still have to be improved. There are still too many bugs."

2/2/2012,ES,4,Focopedo,1.0.1,Cool app,"I haven't been able to sync photos frommy pc since I'm running windows xp and ubuntu 11.10. However, this app has brought the possibility to backup my camera roll photos, and then e showed with style. Very similar to the web version but I miss thr curation option. Overall, a pretty good app"
2/2/2012,ES,3,miguelb75,1.0.1,Falla,Gran aplicacion pero se me cierra sola y no me sube fotos.
2/2/2012,GB,1,Andy Woodhead,1.0.1,Doesn't work,Just a blank screen and no settings. Great idea but needs work
2/2/2012,GB,5,Mark Moss,1.0.1,Very Good App!,"This is an extremely well thought out and intuitive app, great companion for the already great service!Would be amazing to have an iPad version too."
2/2/2012,FR,1,Henrydes,1.0.1,Does not work,"After logged in, a message appears on the top saying ""syncing camera roll"" but nothing happens. Re installed, same symptoms."
2/2/2012,US,5,Francisco Javier Lopez,1.0.1,Truly amazing,I have been waiting for this app. And now that it is here I am more then happy to use it. The service is robust and takes the pain out of photo management. You guys rock...  Where's a donate button? :)
2/2/2012,US,5,Empirical Enigma,1.0.1,Perfect,A beautiful compliment to the web version. Everything works fantastic.
2/2/2012,US,5,SupertrampRs,1.0.1,Perfect,I have been waiting for this app for a long time and it is just perfect. I love it. Thanks and congrats to the everpix team (by thiagolocatelli)
2/2/2012,US,1,pentak3,1.0.1,nothing useful,"I saw an article about this app on flipboard and downloaded it... it asked me to sync photos from iphone and I opted no... that's it, the app started showing me a blank blackish screen... there is no way I can opt in to sync my photos... the only option settings button has is logout... I don't understand why do ppl spend money on advertising an app that doesn't do anything..."
2/2/2012,US,5,Francisco Ramos,1.0.1,Awesome mobile experience from everpix,This app is the perfect compliment to the everpix website. The same great experience and level of detail from site  is now available in my pocket.
2/2/2012,US,5,Pawloo,1.0.1,WOW,The design and feel of this app is amazing!!
2/2/2012,US,5,Ddfhjkbvfdethb,1.0.1,Awesome,Been using this beta as well. It's literally a dream come true to have all pics back to 2002 viewable on my phone without taking up any storage.

2/1/2012,US,5,Austin Bales,1.0.1,Been using this since beta,Really great app and service. It's like photo stream for every photo source.
2/1/2012,US,5,Uggums,1.0.1,Seamless Integration between platforms and devices,Legit cloud photo storing app that works in almost all the places you could conceivably save photos. I wish it did video too but hopefully they will add that someday.
